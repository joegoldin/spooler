Spooler is a web application for logging 3D printing usage. It exposes an API for integration with slicer software for automatic tracking.

Heavily inspired by [Spoolman](https://github.com/Donkie/Spoolman), but with a log of each spool's usage, rather than just total usage to date.

###### Warning: This project was built using heavy use of generative LLMs, use at your own risk. ðŸ¤™

If running in Unraid, make sure to set the `REACT_APP_API_URL` environment variable to the IP address of the host machine, so that the frontend can connect to the backend.

See this example Unraid configuration:
